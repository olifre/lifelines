title: "Frosty Silence"
excerpt: "A hushing cold was embracing us. Freezing, calming down the buzzing activities of all human beings.
A frosty silence, a forlorn remembrance, putting the hustle and bustle to a sudden, temporary halt."

A hushing cold was embracing us. Freezing, calming down the buzzing activities of all human beings.
A frosty silence, a forlorn remembrance, putting the hustle and bustle to a sudden, temporary halt.

Calm, and with a gracious, slow embrace, the cold frost crept into our minds.
Slowing us down, making us remember the warmth of the past.

> Even more than in summer, the cold of winter let's us feel the warmth by nature's and human's embrace.

With a solemn, somehow stern look, the biting frost looks at our selves.
Leaning back, we find the time to stare back, into the cold, but affectionately beating heart which magnifies the silence.

Loud memories of the past all silently appear, as if deafened by the white, beautiful flakes. Their colours seem faded a bit at first,
but slowly, their warmth heats us through and through. In a delicate serenity, we can embrace the past in a winter's dream.

Nostalgia and remembrance are eased by the slowing silence. Looking for warmth, we dream back to the past,
and slowly realize the present and future are not as bad as they seemed to be.

Winter is the time of dreams, allowing the soul to seclude itself and open up at the same time,
preparing for a spring to come, when the buds of emotions may spring open to greet a new, warm morning.
Like a night's sleep, winter is a long, thoughtful time, waking dormant emotions in a half-asleep slumber of silence.

> Even if the world seems white and grey, winter has it's own mystic myriad of colours, as beautiful as the fresh green of spring, the saturated blue and yellow of summer,
> and the multicoloured leaves of autumn.

Unlike the race of summer which strains and develops our bodies, and may stress or starve our emotional soul, the calm of winter allows our minds to reflect upon themselves, and evolve.
Winter is not human hibernation, nor a sudden stop, but a time of recollection and development. A time offering a slowdown, which we can and should accept in this buzzing life.

Healthy synaesthesia of the heart may only unfold when your view is not clouded by the everyday noise, the craze of business, the stressful list of tasks.
Embrace the time of silence, accept it into your self, and let your mind see the colours of winter, to grasp the colours of your self.
