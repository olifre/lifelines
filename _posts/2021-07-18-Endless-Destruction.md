title: "Endless Destruction"
excerpt: "All of a sudden, nature strikes back. Protected memories, kept in a safe haven, destroyed in mere minutes, along with the home,
the place to live. Everything lost and replaced by a boundless solastalgia."

All of a sudden, nature strikes back. Protected memories, kept in a safe haven, destroyed in mere minutes, along with the home,
the place to live. Everything lost and replaced by a boundless solastalgia.
All the energy focused solely on protecting the remnants of the past, the known safety, has exploded in a short burst of anger
and helplessness. Anything worth protecting is gone, and it seems there is nothing more to lose apart from the own life. What can be done?

We have fought against nature, in an endless strife to extract resources, increase our comfort and neglecting any effects.
Science knew, and we had been warned, but often words are not enough to move our hearts and minds and end this carving of a bottomless pit.
A hole which may eat ourselves, our descendants, for ages to come.

---

> With a loud bang, gushing water, and drowning energy, we have been warned. Is the sorrow and eternal loss enough, will it spread through humanity,
> convince us that we can not continue as before?

Traumatized, the strength in our souls fuels itself into power to rebuild, to recreate, to help those in need.
Boundless power overcomes the shackles of exhaustion, moves minds, hearts, and hands.

But when the batteries are burnt, what will remain? Is there enough force to re-spin the globe, after the own world has been pieced together again in a wild frenzy? 
Will the power born from pain and fear channel itself into a movement infecting all, to fight against a seemingly inevitable future
we had banned from our minds and souls? 

---

There is no way out, no escape from this fate. The fight has to start _now_, or we must be silent forever, having invited the future dystopia ourselves.
No painful abdication is needed, but we need to change, realize the new possibilities and chances when reducing the impact on mother nature.

The times of racing against an ever-ticking clock have left us without sensitivity for our surroundings.
The economical rat race has replaced nature with an artificial culture, forcing us to multi-thread in pure asynchronicity without any synchronization points,
losing the self and any serenity required to reflect on the plethora of data sources streaming into our minds and hearts.

Only stepping back, adjusting the pace, re-synchronizing to our selves, we can sense the colours of nature and life again,
and may escape the self-inflicted personal solitude of our minds. 
May this big fight in our lost relationship with nature help to force the necessary tranquillity to spread after all is said and done,
and allow us to realize we must rise to save this relationship to protect our future --- now.
