The future is always an unknown; the best we can do is what we deem to be right."

The pleasure of nostalgia is never without its companion, loneliness.

A dog that burns itself on the fireplace will always be wary.
Those who approach the fireplace are the ones who think that within it smolder roasted chestnuts and are unable to forget that sweet taste.

There were two kinds of strength. One was the strength that came with having something to protect. The other was the strength of having nothing to lose.

Regret could mean struggling to turn back time, or it could mean swearing not to let the same thing happen again. The two meanings were very different.

After all, one could no more peer into the minds of the living than one could the dead, and there was certainly no way to act solely in the interests of another.
If you dug deeply enough, you would always arrive at the conclusion that you had acted in your own interests. The only problem was acting in such a way that you could live with yourself afterward.

Humans fear their own kind more than any wolf or wild animal—one of the world’s great ironies.

If a wolf’s fangs killed the body, then human hostility was death to the spirit.

It seemed sincerely loving someone made one’s thinking faster, but turned it in the most ridiculous directions.

|Spice and Wolf, Vol. 15: The Coin of the Sun I
The many people within the same receptacle known as the world were much like how various textiles were manufactured.
There were vertical threads and horizontal threads crossing each other, and there were things that would not cross in a single lifetime.
Lawrence found it a very mysterious thing.
But that was why on occasion a mysterious thread was weaved into a mysterious cloth.

In this world, many characters walk onto the stage.
And all of them plunge forward toward their many objectives, be they comedies or tragedies.

However, in the end, the world was a cloth woven between each and every person in it; the power of an individual was not great.

Though sometimes a previous king whose throne had been usurped was merely exiled, a former king plotting to usurp the throne was always fated to be slain.

|Spice and Wolf, Vol. 16: The Coin of the Sun II
The powerless always have absurd dreams. Those who have power understand well what power can accomplish.
They understand just because you can carry a boulder does not mean you can move a mountain. It is only those who play with pebbles who dream of moving a mountain.

They were searching for a rainbow.
But it was this place, right where they stood, that was the end of the rainbow.

Perhaps, just as belongings made one hesitate in the face of a journey, the capacity to speak made one hesitate in the face of conversation.
Yet in spite of that, the things one needed to do were very few.

Tasty things were poison for the eyes and poison for the tongue. But one could not crave something they knew nothing about.

Attenborough: But still, humans, no, I mean groups of humans
              why do they have to shed so many billions of liters of blood
              for something that they just needed to talk about ?
Julian: Do you think it's just idiocy ?
Attenborough: I don't know.
              I don't have the right to criticize them.
              After all, I'm one of the very people who shed blood out of foppery and whim.
Julian: It certainly may be an act of idiocy.
        But when humans lose that idiocy, will they evolve for the better ?

Muller: Herr Minci, I wonder which of us is more fortunate.
        When Fleet Admiral Yang passed away, you didn't know of it till it happened.
        On the other hand, we've been given time to prepare ourselves before His Majesty passes away.
        But while your sorrow began at its starting point, we first have to get to the goal
        and then start again to fill the void in our hearts,
        for those of us who are still alive, that is.
Julian: That's right.
        For those of us who are still alive, the journey continues.
        Until the time that they're to join the dead, they must continue to walk to that day, without being allowed to fly and skip.
        Still, the fact that I was able to have heartfelt friendly exchanges with the admirals of the Imperial Force is something I'm pleased with.
        But might that fact plausibly be criticized by posterity as a shameless handshake between mass-murderers ?
        Aside from posterity, I have to accept it no matter how the bereaved of the war dead denounce me.
        But there was no other way.
        In order to create the present circumstances, we had to fight first.

Karin: Hey, Julian, in any case, Starzone Baalat will remain in the hands of democracy, right ?
Julian: Yeah.
        That's all, isn't it, when you think about it ?
        Right - that's all there is.
        To accomplish just this little thing, we needed 500 years of time and billions of lives.
        If only the people hadn't lost their interest in politics around the end of the Galactic Confederation.
        If only they knew how dangerous it was to give unlimited power to a despot and if only they had learned from history how many people would be made unhappy
        under a governmental system that prioritizes national profits over people's rights, we wouldn't have had to sacrifice as much as we did.
        Politics always takes vengeance on those who belittle it.

|Weathering with you
The human mind works in mysterious ways.
Like you just need to see the sun shining in the morning to feel energized.
A blue sky makes you feel happy you're alive.
It makes you feel more in love with that someone by your side.
[...]
We could really influence people by the weather.
I realized how much the human heart is connected to the sky.

Have you heard about how human emotions affect random number generators?
Random number generators are machines that spit out either a one or a zero based on quantum theory.
The probability's always one in two. But when there are huge disasters or other big events that shake up a lot of people,
for that one instant, they say the probability changes dramatically.
They've witnessed the phenomenon in action lots of times, all over the world.
So I had a thought. Human wishes and prayers might actually have the power to change the world for real.
Maybe there's more to our brains than just what's in our skulls. 
In some way, they may be connected to the whole world. Like how smartphones are connected to the cloud, even though you can't see it.

Hatred can't stop once it's begun.
And it's a chain of hatred that you can't do anything about.
That's probably what war is.

Roswaal: I have never once forgotten the one and only vow that you and I exchanged.
Ram: Those who wield the sword should die by the sword, those who rely on magic should die by magic, and those who give themselves to fire should die by fire.
Roswaal: And those who ask favors of a demon should die by that demon.
         Whatever one relies upon should be the thing that brings about their death.

"Why do we close our eyes when we pray, when we cry, when we kiss, when we dream; because the most beautiful things in our life are not seen, but felt only by the heart."

The sun rises from the edge of the mountains. Little by little, the daylight washes over the lake town.
The birds in the morning, the hush at midday, the insect songs in the evening, the glitter of the night sky.
The sun rises between the buildings. Little by little, the daylight glints off countless windows.
The throngs of people in the morning, the hum of midday, the scents of everyday life at half-light, the sparkle of the streets at night.
Over and over, we’re captivated by moments like these.
And, gradually, we learn.

A mother’s gentle voice.
Then, with a brutal sensation, the umbilical cord is cut.
Even though we were all two who lived as one in the beginning, even though we were all connected, so humans are severed from the cord and fall into this life.

After the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it’s loneliness.
In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all that stays with me. I’ll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone’s forced me to take.
"Fine", I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is loneliness, I’ll still live with everything I’ve
got. Even if this emotion is all I have, I’ll keep struggling. Even if we’re separated, even if we never meet again,
I’ll fight. As if I’d ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting resolution feels as though I’m picking a fight
with the gods. Very soon, I’ll forget even the fact that I’ve forgotten something.
And so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky one last time:
“What’s your name?”
The cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains. Asking its question of the void over and over, it diminishes, bit by bit.
Finally, silence descends.

|Makoto Shinkai

Just a little longer, I think.
Just a little is fine. Just a little more.
I don’t know what it is I want, but I keep on wishing for something.
Just a little longer. Just a little more.
The cherry blossoms bloom and scatter, long rains wash the streets, white clouds billow high, the leaves change color, freezing winds blow. Then the cherry trees bloom again.

"Where do human memories live?
 Are they in the synaptic circuitry of the brain? Do retinas and fingertips hold memories, too?
 Or is there an invisible, amorphous, mistlike, spiritual collective somewhere, and that’s where the memories reside?
 Something we’d call the heart or the mind or the soul.
 Is it something you can take out and stick back in, like a memory card with an OS on it?"

In the book, Taki wonders to himself about this.
Humans are mysterious creatures. We forget the important things, and all we remember are the things that don’t matter.
Unlike memory cards, we don’t have the ability to keep the important stuff and delete what we don’t need. I always wondered why that was.
However, now that I’ve read this book, I feel as if I understand, just a little.
People forget the important things.
That said, by resisting, by struggling against that, they gain life.
